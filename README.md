# Hide Twitter Retweets

A Chrome extension to remove retweets from Twitter.

## How it works

It scans the webpage for the word `"Retweeted"` and then hides the DOM element.
Your own retweets, and Twitter's `Notifications` page will continue to be displayed.

## Usage

Use it as a locally installed extension:

Clone this repository, then go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser, and "Load unpacked". Make sure "Developer mode" at the Top-Right is enabled in Chrome Extensions. This will install the extension. You should not see the right side bar when you navigate to Twitter. Happy browsing!
